This is going to be replacment for GameplayTags from Engine.

It will mirror all funcionality. The main differences:
1. Different data store. All Tags will be stored in TArray.
2. Access to tags will be by index. There is no search involved, tags are read from array directly by
their index.
3. Tag Editor, inside UE4Editor. Importing CSV files will be no longer needed!
